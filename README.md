# imageUpdaterV1.0
Very basic c# console program that is looking after the files in your selected directory (this particular is looking for jpeg, jpg files)
and whenever changes appear, i.e. file was added to directory, file name was changed, copy was made or file was deleted - changes will be displayed 
in console window, written to txt file and saved to database. 
***** Important! **** 
program is hardcoded to get the name of the file, etc. from particular input. All my images are named as "10.0.14.2_NUMBERLATE.JPG", 
as images are taken from anpr camera. This is done to get correct number plate from image name.
****** Also! ****
The snippets of code were borrowed from MSDN examples. Some code was changed, some stayed as it was. 
Code is far from being perfect, with some redundand functions, but the aim was to make it work, and improvements might follow :-)
